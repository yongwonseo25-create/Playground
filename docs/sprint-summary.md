> Codex must read this file before starting any new sprint or major coding task.
> At the end of each sprint, Codex must update this file with the latest architecture, changed files, risks, and next prerequisites.

## Project Identity

- Project: Voxera (Listen-Think-Act)
- Type: B2B voice execution agent front-end
- Stack: Next.js App Router + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- Core mode: mobile-first, voice-first, state-driven

---

## Constitutional Guardrails

### 1. Audio Engine Rule
- MediaRecorder is forbidden.
- Blob/timeslice recording is forbidden.
- Audio must use **AudioWorklet + PCM over WSS** only.

### 2. Cost Defense Rule
- Every recording session must stop at **exactly 15 seconds**.
- The state machine + timer logic is the source of truth.
- UI animation must never be the source of business truth.

### 3. Duplicate Locking Rule
- Every upload must be protected by `clientRequestId`.
- Submission must be locked before async upload begins.
- Duplicate upload / duplicate charge must be prevented.

### 4. Fixed State Machine Rule
The following 8 states are fixed and must not be arbitrarily restructured:
- `idle`
- `permission-requesting`
- `ready`
- `recording`
- `stopping`
- `uploading`
- `success`
- `error`

## Current Architecture Snapshot

### App Structure
- Status: stable foundation complete
- Current routing approach: Next.js App Router with route groups
- Current feature folder approach: feature-first structure centered on `features/voice`
- Current UI shell status: initial mobile-first voice shell implemented and manually QA-verified

### Voice State Machine
- Status: implemented and stable
- Source of truth file(s):
  - `src/features/voice/machine/voice-machine.types.ts`
  - `src/features/voice/machine/voice-machine.ts`
  - `src/features/voice/machine/voice-machine.selectors.ts`
- Current states:
  - `idle`
  - `permission-requesting`
  - `ready`
  - `recording`
  - `stopping`
  - `uploading`
  - `success`
  - `error`
- Current selectors: start/stop availability, busy state, submit lock visibility, permission hint visibility
- Current known guard rules:
  - permission request cannot re-enter while already in flight
  - insecure context is blocked
  - upload lock blocks duplicate submission
  - reducer remains pure and side effects are externalized

### Audio Engine
- Status: architecture fixed, implementation not yet started in code
- Audio input approach: AudioWorklet + PCM only
- Audio transport approach: secure WSS only
- Audio cleanup strategy: planned, not yet implemented
- Secure context requirement: mandatory

### Transport
- Status: env and secure transport policy prepared
- WSS endpoint strategy: env-driven
- Webhook adapter strategy: planned for Sprint 2
- Env validation status: implemented for secure endpoint handling

### Submission / Cost Defense
- Status: architecture prepared, full integration pending
- 15-second cutoff status: constitutional requirement fixed, full runtime integration pending
- `clientRequestId` lock status: architectural rule fixed, full integration pending
- Duplicate prevention strategy: reducer-driven lock model defined, end-to-end submission flow pending

### Mobile UX
- Status: initial shell complete
- One-handed usage support: yes
- Safe-area support: baseline implemented
- Accessibility status: baseline labels and touch sizing applied
- Error messaging status: shell-level support prepared

## Instructions for Codex Before Any New Sprint

Before starting a sprint, Codex must:

1. Read this file.
2. Restate the current architecture in brief.
3. Confirm these non-negotiable rules:
   - AudioWorklet + PCM over WSS only
   - Exact 15-second cutoff
   - `clientRequestId` duplicate lock
   - 8-state reducer preserved
4. Then proceed with coding.

After finishing a sprint, Codex must:

1. Update the relevant sprint section.
2. Update Current Architecture Snapshot.
3. Update Current Known Risks.
4. Update Current Manual Regression Checklist if needed.
